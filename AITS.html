    <h3>Founder & Secretary's Greetings</h3>
    <h5>It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Annamacharya Institute of Technology & Sciences website. I hope our website gives a glance at our<br>institution. Our aim is to mould the rural children of this region as highly enlightened professionals
        endowed with innovative technical skills<br><br>Education liberates people from the shackles of societal and economic inequities. It is a force that brings in happiness enhancing the living standards<br>of rural families. All the children are
        not blessed with a chance, due to different reasons, to pursue studies in IITs and so called best institutions mostly<br>in urban locations.<br><br>This is a group established in multiple locations to cater to the needs of the all sections of
        the society mostly from rural background. I humbly say that<br>our vision and dreams have become a reality, as in these two decades, our institute has earned the distinction as one of the best institutes in the state.<br>This became possible because
        of the wholehearted and untiring efforts of all the people associated with the institute. Still we have to thrive more and<br>see that this institute is developed as the best institute in the country. I thank all the students, parents, administration
        and our faculty members who<br>are trying their best to turn my dream a reality. I assure you that you will have an enlightening educational experience and wish you all the best.</h5>
